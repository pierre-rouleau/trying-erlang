# trying-erlang
A collection of small Erlang snippets

This repository of Erlang code snippets is something I'm going to write while
taking the [Concurrent Programming in
Erlang](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/concurrent-programming-erlang)
online course provided by the [University of
Kent](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/the-university-of-kent) and
[FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/).

I also have a separate repository of various notes [about Erlang](https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/about-erlang) and
[development on macOS](https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/about-macOS) that I
use for developing Erlang-based code among other things.

I have always been interested in various programming languages and Lisp is
one of them. Because of that I started learning Emacs in the last year and have
created a project where I document what I learn and create a environment that
should be easy to use for new Emacs users and integrates a growing number of
Emacs internal and external packages.
I called that project PEL
(for [Pragmatic Environment Library](https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel)).
I'll try to get some time to add Erlang
facilities to PEL during the time I am following this course.
Hopefully I'll have enough time to do something useful.


The list of exercises follows:

- [Exercise 1: Palindrome Checking Server](exercises/e1/exercise-1.rst)
- [Exercise 2: Working with the mailbox](exercises/e2/exercise-2.rst)
