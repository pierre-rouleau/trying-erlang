# trying-erlang
A collection of small Erlang snippets and modules

This repository of Erlang code snippets is something I'm going to write while
I'm in the process of learning Erlang, OTP and some other programming languages
that run on the Erlang Vm (like Elixir).

For that I am reading several Erlang books, upgrading my Emacs environment to better
support the languages and tools I use
(see [PEL - Pragmatic Environment Library](https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/pel), writing on Erlang here and in
sibling projects
[About Erlang](https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/about-erlang)
and [development on macOS](https://github.com/pierre-rouleau/about-macOS).
I'm also taking online courses (everything goes online these days...)..

# Course - Concurrent Programming in Erlang

The courses I'm taking is the [Concurrent Programming in
Erlang](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/concurrent-programming-erlang)
online course provided by the [University of
Kent](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/the-university-of-kent) and
[FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/).

The list of exercises in this course I've done so far are listed here:

- [Exercise 1: Palindrome Checking Server](exercises/e1/exercise-1.rst)
- [Exercise 2: Working with the mailbox](exercises/e2/exercise-2.rst)
- [Exercise 3: Frequency Server](exercises/e3/frequency-server.rst)
- [Exercise 4: Frequency Server with a Functional Interface](exercises/e4/frequency-server-with-funct-if.rst)


# Book - Erlang and OTP in Action

I enjoy reading [Erlang and OTP in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/erlang-and-otp-in-action).
Written in 2010, it describes
the OTP facilities available at that time.  It has several examples as well.
I'm planning to implement several of the examples provided in the book  and
check what has changed in the last 10 years.

This includes the following:

- [A TCP-based RPC service](erlang-and-otp-in-action/otpa-1/ch3ex.rst)
