# trying-erlang
A collection of small Erlang snippets

This repository of Erlang code snippets is something I'm going to write while
taking the [Concurrent Programming in
Erlang](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/concurrent-programming-erlang)
online course provided by the [University of
Kent](https://www.futurelearn.com/partners/the-university-of-kent) and
[FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/).
